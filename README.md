# Homework
I do my hw in this

Add  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj  
  to chrome and make sure to use Local instead of Cloud.
   
Then use   
 https://brandfolder.com/workbench/extract-text-from-image 

To convert the image to text.

Or just use lightshot




DISCLAMER: If anyone from my computer science class just so happens to stumble across my homework and wants to copy...                                                             
its your grades not mine.
