Add

  to chrome and make sure to use Local instead of Cloud.
   
Then use

To convert the image to text.

Or just use lightshot

DISCLAMER: If anyone from my computer science class just so happens to stumble across my homework and wants to copy...  
its your grades not mine.
Oh and general rule is dont copy something you don't understand cuz its just gonna be obvious you got it from me.
