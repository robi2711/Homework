Verse 1:
Listen up, I'm gonna tell you 'bout a woman of great renown
Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who turned heads around
She was working on software, long before it was cool
Her work was groundbreaking, she was nobody's fool

Chorus:
Margaret Hamilton, she's the queen of code
A pioneer in computing, the industry's lodestar and node
She wrote the software for the moon landing, her code was clean
She broke through barriers and showed us what women can achieve

Verse 2:
She worked at MIT in the early sixties
When computing was still a fledgling industry
She designed software for the Apollo spacecraft
And when it landed on the moon, it was her code that laughed

Chorus:
Margaret Hamilton, she's the queen of code
A pioneer in computing, the industry's lodestar and node
She wrote the software for the moon landing, her code was clean
She broke through barriers and showed us what women can achieve

Verse 3:
She was a trailblazer, a leader, a star
She showed the world that women could go far
She inspired a generation of young coders
And showed them that the sky's the limit, just like those Apollo rovers

Chorus:
Margaret Hamilton, she's the queen of code
A pioneer in computing, the industry's lodestar and node
She wrote the software for the moon landing, her code was clean
She broke through barriers and showed us what women can achieve

Outro:
So let's give a shout-out to Margaret Hamilton
A computer scientist who showed us what women can become
She's an inspiration to all, a hero to me and you
Margaret Hamilton, we salute you!
