1. Recursion means breaking the problem down into subsetsof the same problem
2. A recusrsive function is a function that calls itself
3. It will give an error that the maximum recursion depth of 1000 has been reached
4. base case
5. recursive depth is the amount of times the function will call itself
6. 1000
7. Defining the rucursive function
Defining the base case
Specifying the value that must be returned when base case is reached
8. On the way back up
9. Iwl im not bothered recursion is better and idc
