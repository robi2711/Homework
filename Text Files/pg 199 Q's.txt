1. If you want to change something you have to change it everywhere, it is time consuming
2. A function is a task that can be carried out by the computer
3. If we want to change something we only have to change it once in the def, args make it easy to use the code for different things
4. def __():
5. Defining a function doesnt run it, while calling it will run the function
6. We must specify if it has any arguments and specify if it should return a value
7. Anything outside of defs that runs without it having to be called in the code
8. An argument is a variable that can be specified when the function is called
9. It makes the code easy to change to ehat you want it to be, also allows user input
10. A suitable name, the args, the body of the function
11. Functions should be meaningful and with lowercase letters
12. If multiple variables should be changed like height or weight
13. The volume of a cylinder
14. If height is specified as the first argument and you put it in on the second then you would be inputting the wrong height
15. Functions are usually specified at the top of the code and if you have to constantly scroll through the code it makes it harder to read
16. They are usefull because it doesnt matter what order you specify the arguments in.
