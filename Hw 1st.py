"""
1. A test case uses a set of conditions to test a piece of code.
2. The purpose of running codes with a test case is to try stop errors and make the code work as it should
3.
ID
Description
Test data
expected result
Acutual result
passed
4. the expected value is the correct value and the actual value is the output of the code
5. The golden rule is that you should never take the expected resultr from the output
6. covering every case o fthe code
7. Equvilance partition is when the range of conditions are put into an are that have the same behaviour
8. This is just high numbers that are not expected
9. testting the values at the boundries of partions
10. Anticipating an error in the code before it happens
11. There might be ages over 100
12. To ensure easier flow of code and readability
"""
# Task 1
"""
number under 0 can be used
"""
#Task 2
"""
The input can be something like h and the code wouldnt work
"""
#Task 3
#Nothing wrong with the code
